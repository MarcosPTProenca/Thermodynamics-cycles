# Thermodynamics cycles
 Using python to return the results and graphs of thermodynamics cycles, such as Rankine Cycle
 
> ## About The Project

This is a program that returns the results of the Rankine Cycle according to the pressures on the state 2 and state 4 the user decides. The Rankine cycle or Rankine Vapor Cycle is the process widely used by power plants such as coal-fired power plants or nuclear reactors. In this mechanism, a fuel is used to produce heat within a boiler, converting water into steam which then expands through a turbine producing useful work.
